                <b>Abstract</b>&nbsp; Detecting hot social events (e.g. political scandal, momentous meetings, natural
                hazards, etc.) from social messages is crucial as it highlights significant happenings to help people
                understand the real world. On account of the streaming nature of social messages, incremental social
                event detection models in acquiring, preserving, and updating messages over time have attracted great
                attention. However, the challenge is that the existing event detection methods towards streaming social
                messages are generally confronted with ambiguous events features, dispersive text contents, and multiple
                languages, and hence result in low accuracy and generalization ability. In this paper, we present a
                novel reinForced, incremental and cross-lingual social Event detection architecture, namely FinEvent,
                from streaming social messages. Concretely, we first model social messages into heterogeneous graphs
                integrating both rich meta-semantics and diverse meta-relations, and convert them to weighted
                multi-relational message graphs. Secondly, we propose a new reinforced weighted multi-relational graph
                neural network framework by using a Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning algorithm to select optimal
                aggregation thresholds across different relations/edges to learn social message embeddings. To solve the
                long-tail problem in social event detection, a balanced sampling strategy guided Contrastive Learning
                mechanism is designed for incremental social message representation learning. Thirdly, a new Deep
                Reinforcement Learning guided density-based spatial clustering model is designed to select the optimal
                minimum number of samples required to form a cluster and optimal minimum distance between two clusters
                in social event detection tasks. Finally, we implement incremental social message representation
                learning based on knowledge preservation on the graph neural network and achieve the transferring
                cross-lingual social event detection. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the FinEvent on
                Twitter streams, demonstrating a significant and consistent improvement in model quality with 14%-118%,
                8%-170%, and 2%-21% increases in performance on offline, online, and cross-lingual social event
                detection tasks.</p>

                The above figure shows the incremental lifecycle and cross language transmission mechanism in the
                FinEvent architecture.
                FinEvent performs social event detection in an incremental life-cycle mechanism. The design of FinEvent
                architecture aims at being consistent with the streaming nature of social messages and real situations
                in event detection. Concretely, we require a flexible architecture to i). deal with the streaming nature
                of social messages in an online manner; ii). continuously acquire, preserve and extend the message
                semantics; iii). handle the actual problems, especially the cross-lingual event detection task. In
                addition, FinEvent is also capable of realizing cross-lingual transfer.

                <b>FinEvent architecture</b>&nbsp;
                FinEvent can realize offline, online, and cross-lingual social event detection by utilizing both social
                messages representation learning framework MarGNN, cross-lingual social message representation learning
                method Crlme, and social event clustering detection model DRLDBSCAN.
                The above figure shows the proposed framework FinEvent with five important modules. For the original
                social messages, we first convert them into a weighted multi-relational graph. Then we use multi-agent
                reinforcement learning to select neighbors for different relations, and obtain the aggregation of all
                messages through the weighted multirelational graph neural network . In order to balance sampling and
                cope with incremental detection scenarios, a strategy-based contrast learning mechanism is used to train
                the GNN. Finally, we use the DBSCAN model guided by deep reinforcement learning for event clustering
                parameter debugging.

                <b>Conclusion</b>&nbsp;
                This article introduces a social event detection architecture based on streaming social messages,
                FinEvent, and proposes a multi-agent reinforcement learning guided multi graph neural network framework,
                MarGNN, and a density space clustering model based on deep reinforcement learning, DRL-DBSCAN, to
                improve the performance of FinEvent. The experimental results indicate that FinEvent has achieved
                significant and consistent improvements in offline, online, and cross language social event detection
                tasks. In the future, researchers plan to extend multi-agent RL guided GNN to other graph data
                representations and their application fields.
